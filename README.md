# zabbix-agent2-ubuntu1604
Ah shit, here we go again

build zabbix-agent2 deb package for ubuntu1604(not supported by zabbix :/ only 18.04+) but for local use 16 still ok(with some kernel patches) on old PC/Server/NAS 

basic for 5.4.12(yes its not LTS but маемо шо маемо) change version in rules and build_zbx.bash files if you need another(go version also must match your wants)
